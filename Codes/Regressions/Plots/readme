To visualize and evaluate the performance of regressions, I plotted the predicted ROR and actual ROR as well as calculating their MSE.
I used 2 methods to do this. 

1. Predict the ROR of the last observation in the current window size using the coefficients yielded by the current window size.

2. Predict the ROR of the following observation outside the current window size using the coefficients yielded by the current window size.
